# UK Polar Data Centre (UK PDC) Metadata Record Generator

API for generating metadata records using templates and per-record data

...

## Setup

```shell
$ git clone https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/uk-pdc/metadata-infrastructure/metadata-generator.git
$ cd metadata-generator
```

### Local development

Docker and Docker Compose are required to setup a local development environment of this application.

#### Local development - Docker Compose

If you have access to the [BAS GitLab instance](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk), you can pull the application Docker 
image from the BAS Docker Registry. Otherwise you will need to build the Docker image locally.

```shell
# If you have access to gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk
$ docker login docker-registry.data.bas.ac.uk
$ docker-compose pull
# If you don't have access
$ docker-compose build
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the file to set at least any required (uncommented) options.

To run the application using the Flask development server (which reloads automatically if source files are changed):

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

To run other commands against the Flask application (such as [Integration tests](#integration-tests)):

```shell
# in a separate terminal to `docker-compose up`
$ docker-compose run app flask [command]
# E.g.
$ docker-compose run app flask test
# List all available commands
$ docker-compose run app flask
```

## Development

This API is developed as a Flask application.

...

Also ensure:

* [Integration tests](#integration-tests) are updated to prevent future regression
* [End-user documentation](#documentation) is updated

### Code Style

PEP-8 style and formatting guidelines must be used for this project, with the exception of the 80 character line limit.

[Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/) is used to ensure compliance, and is ran on each commit through 
[Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration).

To check compliance locally:

```shell
$ docker-compose run app flake8 . --ignore=E501
```

### Dependencies

Python dependencies should be defined using Pip through the `requirements.txt` file. The Docker image is configured to
install these dependencies into the application image for consistency across different environments. Dependencies should
be periodically reviewed and updated as new versions are released.

To add a new dependency:

```shell
$ docker-compose run app ash
$ pip install [dependency]==
# this will display a list of available versions, add the latest to `requirements.txt`
$ exit
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose build
```

If you have access to the BAS GitLab instance, push the rebuilt Docker image to the BAS Docker Registry:

```shell
$ docker login docker-registry.data.bas.ac.uk
$ docker-compose push
```

### Dependency vulnerability scanning

To ensure the security of this API, all dependencies are checked against 
[Snyk]() for vulnerabilities. 

**Warning:** Snyk relies on known vulnerabilities and can't check for issues that are not in it's database. As with all 
security tools, Snyk is an aid for spotting common mistakes, not a guarantee of secure code.

Some vulnerabilities have been ignored in this project, see `.snyk` for definitions and the 
[Dependency exceptions](#dependency-vulnerability-exceptions) section for more information.

Through [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration), on each commit current dependencies are tested and a snapshot
uploaded to Snyk. This snapshot is then monitored for vulnerabilities.

#### Dependency vulnerability exceptions

This project contains known vulnerabilities that have been ignored for a specific reason.

* [Py-Yaml `yaml.load()` function allows Arbitrary Code Execution](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-PYYAML-42159)
    * currently no known or planned resolution
    * indirect dependency, required through the `bandit` package
    * severity is rated *high*
    * risk judged to be *low* as we don't use the Yaml module in this application
    * ignored for 1 year for re-review

### Static security scanning

To ensure the security of this API, source code is checked against [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) for issues 
such as not sanitising user inputs or using weak cryptography. 

**Warning:** Bandit is a static analysis tool and can't check for issues that are only be detectable when running the 
application. As with all security tools, Bandit is an aid for spotting common mistakes, not a guarantee of secure code.

Through [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration), each commit is tested.

To check locally:

```shell
$ docker-compose run app bandit -r .
```

### Debugging

To debug using PyCharm:

* *Run* -> *Edit Configurations*
* *Add New Configuration* -> *Python*

In *Configuration* tab:

* Script path: `[absolute path to project]/manage.py`
* Python interpreter: *Project interpreter* (*app* service in project Docker Compose)
* Working directory: `[absolute path to project]`
* Path mappings: `[absolute path to project]=/usr/src/app`

## Testing

### Integration tests

This project uses integration tests to ensure features work as expected and to guard against regressions and 
vulnerabilities.

The Python [UnitTest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) library is used for running tests using Flask's 
test framework. Test cases are defined in files within `tests/` and are automatically loaded when using the 
`test` Flask CLI command.

Tests are automatically ran on each commit through [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration).

To run tests manually:

```shell
$ docker-compose run -e FLASK_ENV=testing app flask test
```

To run tests using PyCharm:

* *Run* -> *Edit Configurations*
* *Add New Configuration* -> *Python Tests* -> *Unittests*

In *Configuration* tab:

* Script path: `[absolute path to project]/tests`
* Python interpreter: *Project interpreter* (*app* service in project Docker Compose)
* Working directory: `[absolute path to project]`
* Path mappings: `[absolute path to project]=/usr/src/app`

**Note:** This configuration can be also be used to debug tests (by choosing *debug* instead of *run*).

### Continuous Integration

All commits will trigger a Continuous Integration process using GitLab's CI/CD platform, configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

This process will run the application [Integration tests](#integration-tests).

Pip dependencies are also [checked and monitored for vulnerabilities](#dependency-vulnerability-scanning).

## Deployment

### Deployment - Local development

In development environments, the API is ran using the Flask development server through the project Docker container.

Code changes will be deployed automatically by Flask reloading the application where a source file changes.

See the [Local development](#local-development) sub-section in the [Setup](#setup) section for more information.

## Release procedure

### At release

For all releases:

1. create a release branch
2. if needed, build & push the Docker image
3. close release in `CHANGELOG.md`
4. push changes, merge the release branch into `master` and tag with version

The application will be automatically deployed into production using [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment).
